Phalen ends his book this way: 'today, we are at an important crossroad with respect to the future of air pollutant regulation. One road involves performing the needed research and making decisions on the basis of the science, with full consideration of the many tradeoffs associated with new regulation. The other road involves adopting regulations driven by politics and pressure groups. The first road is obviously the more beneficial one for protecting human health. However, it requires a more patient and reasoned approach that invests in research, allows time for the science to work, and then allows the time needed for technological change. The second approach promises uncontrolled, chaotic, and rapidly changing rules. A great deal is at stake. Will science and reason, or expediency, rear and ignorance be the determinants of public health decisions. To travel the better road, there must be a new era of cooperation and communication among scientists, regulators, legislators, advocacy groups, and the public.'\nGary F.

Distillation, he notes, can be used to separate solvents from heavy residues, polymers, or inorganic solids (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 discusses separation of solvents by batch or continuous fractionation. Drying of solvents is the topic of Chapter 7. The author's expertise (the book jacket says Smallwood has been responsible for building two solvent refineries containing a large number of continuous and batch fractionation units) is shown by such sections (in the separation of solvents chapters) as a 'checklist of crucial problems.'\nUsed solvent disposal is the subject of Chapter 8. Methods for disposal of solvents are listed as: (1) combustion in cement kilns, (2) production of steam, (3) thermal or catalytic vapor incineration, (4) biological treatment, and (5) return to supplier.",

Smallwood, 2nd edition, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., Osney Mead, Oxford, UK, 2002, £ 125.00 (UK), 432 pp., ISBN 0-632-05647-9\nOrganic solvents are ubiquitous chemicals used in large amounts by the modern chemical industry. Unfortunately, they end up being destroyed or vaporized where they make up approximately 35% of the VOC compounds that enter the atmosphere. This book addresses those losses by providing practical guidance on technologies available for solvent recovery and recycling.\nThe first task in solvent recovery/reuse is to separate the solvents from their current environment. To this end, Smallwood has three initial chapters entitled:\n· Separation of solvents from the gas phase;\n· Separation of solvents for reuse.\n· Separation of solvents from water;\nIn the gas phase chapter, Smallwood discusses scrubbing, adsorption on activated carbon, condensation, and membrane system separation. As he does throughout the book, the author includes excellent process flow diagrams, pictures of actual equipment, and tables of relevant data.",
