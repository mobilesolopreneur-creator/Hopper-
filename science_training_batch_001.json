Some researchers had postulated that neurogenesis has contributed to the hippocampal learning and memory. This project was designed to observe the effect of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( ∆ 9 -THC) in cognitive performance that influenced by the neurogenesis. Different doses of ∆ 9 -THC were used for observing the neurogenesis mechanism occurs in the hippocampus of rats. The brains were stained with antibodies, namely BrdU, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), nestin, doublecortin (DCX) and class III β -tubulin (TuJ-1). The cognitive test was used novel-object discrimination test (NOD) while the proteins involved, DCX and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were measured. Throughout this study, ∆ 9 -THC enhanced the markers involved in all stages of neurogenesis mechanism. Simultaneously, the cognitive behaviour of rat also showed",

However, the study has reported the cognitive impairment accompanied with the treatment of ∆ 9 -THC, which was contrast with present study. Taken together by other reports, ∆ 9 -THC cannot be plainly categorised into impairing or enhancing (Abush and Akirav 2010), indeed it requires more research considering the route of administration, region of brain affected (Lorivel and Hilber 2007), and behavioural test used (Wolf et al. 2010). Although the present study did not elaborate on the receptor involved, many reports have elucidate the involvement of CB1 in the neurogenesis and cognition functions, taking into account the abundant volume of CB1 in the brain as compared to CB2 (Jin et al. 2004). The inhibition of CB1 had been reported to decrease the rate of neurogenesis process (Jin et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2006).",

The resulting alloy compositions were most often a deep eutectic composition [2,5,7,9,17 e 24] where the liquid is more stable than competing crystalline phases, which suggests that a deep eutectic is associated with the composition of a BMG. According to Li et al. [23,24], the Zr e Ti e Cu and Zr e Cu e Al alloy systems have several BMGs. Although their compositions are close to each other, their BMGs belong to distinct and separate ternary eutectic systems. This implies that if a deep eutectic system is found and its eutectic point is known, a BMG composition could be found by exploring alloys around the eutectic point.",

Conventionally, Cu as a melting point depressant has been added in Ti or Zr to develop /uniFB01 ller alloys for Ti alloy brazing. In addition, either Ni or the combination of Cu with Ni greatly reduces the melting point of the Ti- or Zr-based materials. Many Ti- or Zr-based /uniFB01 ller alloys have been developed by alloying Cu and Ni into Ti and Zr [11 e 15]. Furthermore, due to the Cu-induced decrease in the melting point, the GFA diameter of the pseudo-binary eutectic alloy was enhanced from 1 mm to 3 mm, consistent with an increased T rg value. The increased stability of the liquid phase of the alloys allowed it to remain glass at lower temperatures.",

In binary Ti e Cu and Zr e Cu systems, there have been two reports of BMG formation near their low-melting eutectic points, despite the fact that they are in a simple binary system [18,36]. This was attributed to their highly ordered eutectic phases such as Ti2Cu3 e TiCu4 in the Ti e Cu system and Cu10Zr7 e Cu8Zr3 in the Zr e Cu system. In conclusion, the results from these previous studies and the present one explain the BMG formability of eutectic alloys that consist of two or more intermetallics.",

From the kinetic viewpoint for bulk glass formation, the best glass former in the hypoeutectic alloy on the Zr2Cu-rich area is attributed to the following factors; (1) the Zr2Cu phase may require longer-range diffusion to be crystallized, compared with the other Zr2Ni and (Zr,Ti)2Ni phases; (2) the melting point of the Zr2Cu phase at 1273 K is lower than that of the Zr2Ni phase at 1393 K [30].

Discussion\nIn the ternary Zr e Ti e Ni and Zr e Ti e Cu systems [29], the existence of (Zr,Ti)2Ni and Cu2(Ti,Zr) Laves phases in the central area of each system are believed to contribute to the formation of lowmelting eutectic alloys. Because the Laves phases are centered in their systems, the partial ternary eutectic or peritectic systems involve Ti or Zr solid solutions as well as TixCuy/ZrxCuy, and TixNiy/ ZrxNiy intermetallics. The Laves phases should participate in all eutectic-forming reactions. The extended quaternary Zr e Ti e Ni e Cu systemoffers an even greater variety of eutectic systems. This ability to form low-melting eutectic systems is responsible for the developmentofanumberofBMGs[5,7,9,23]andthebasis of brazing /uniFB01 ller alloys [11 e 15]. The best glass former Zr49Ti14Ni20Cu17 of this study is in one of the partial eutectic systems in the Zr e Ti",

THCA is actually decarboxylated to produce THC, the main psychoactive component in the Cannabis plant.\nAssuming as the research hypothesis a correlation between the gene copy number and the production of THC, gene quantification could be useful in forensics in order to complement or replace chemical analysis for the identification and classification of seized Cannabis samples, thus distinguishing the drugtype from the fibre-type varieties.",
